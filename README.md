- ðŸ”„ **Auto-Detection**: Supports both JavaScript (.jsx) and TypeScript (.tsx)
- ðŸ“‚ **Component Registry**: Easily manage your collection of components
- ðŸŽ¨ **Built-in Libraries**: Comes with Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Lucide icons, and more
- ðŸ”§ **CLI Tools**: Add, delete, and list components with simple commands
